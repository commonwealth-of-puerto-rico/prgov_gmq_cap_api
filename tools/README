The following readme explains the different commands
and gives some insight into what to do with their output.

Thor:
-----

First thing's first. In order to use the commands, you must

After installing thor, simply type 'thor list'.
For help, see 'thor help'.

====================
Generate a Password:
====================

Usage: thor gmq:generate:user

Description:
------------
This command generates a random, cryptographic salted
password.

================
Generate a User:
================

Usage: thor gmq:generate:user <username> <group1>, <group2>... 

Description:
-----------
For the PR.gov GMQ, the CAP API security groups are as follow:
"admin","all","sijc","webapp","worker" 

"admin" is a security group that has access to /cap/admin/* resources,
such as: http://localhost:9000/v1/cap/admin/groups

"all" is a system generated default. You don't need to specify a 
user as a member of this group. The system automatically adds it to
all users.

"sijc" is a security group that allows access to the certificate_ready
resource. 

"webapp" is a security group for the PR.gov web application. It allows 
access to the creation of transactions. Such as a POST request to:
http://localhost:9000/v1/cap/transaction 

"worker" is a security group that allows access to the GMQ workers
to grab transaction jobs from the queue and process them. 

----
When creating a user, you need to assign them a security group.
Such as:

thor gmq:generate:user prgov_user webapp 

That would output the JSON line that you'd need to append inside the 
/api/config/users.json

Example /api/config/users.json:
{
  "rci"         : { "passkey" : "9b9b2a8ddf62329a6031d8d2724275c5e1daa72c01dbd2026a83615f",
                    "groups"  :  ["sijc"]  },
  "cap_webapp"	: { "passkey" : "299a18a088f2e1e08074863cc03f6b699307eb895fdcd5c2c404e294",
                    "groups"  : ["webapp"] },
  "cap_worker"	: { "passkey" : "8db7ec2e5b82a85bb70d5f245a6f20e9544e2d169c47d3b6935f818a",
                    "groups"  : ["worker"] },
  "cap_admin"   : { "passkey" : "759528379170710b70d0e17e62cd142931db535d07bcb8cb4bffe6d9",
		                "groups"  : ["admin"]  }
}
